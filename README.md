Instructions to compile and run are found in 'instructions.txt' (It will be the same as to compile and run the sample framework he gave us for this project)

Design assumptions: 

- We implemented all the features except for 'Two degrees of seperation' because we ran out of time we didn't quite get to it. 
- We assumed that price could be an attrubute on th, because the period table didn't make any sense to us. The assignment requirments don't say anything 
about how the price is supposed to be inputed, or how time periods get specified. Since we didn't understand how that info was supposed to get into the database 
via the software system, we decided we could have it inputed when a th is created and have it be coupled to the th directly. That was the only way it made sense to 
us in building the software based on the requirements because it wasn't specific enough about how that data gets into the db.
